# Fraud-Detection--SQL-Python-
Fraud Detection using SQL and Python with Machine learning
## Project Overview
This project detects fraudulent financial transactions using SQL, Python, and Machine Learning.
SQLite is used for data storage, Python is used for analysis, and Random Forest is used for prediction.

## Tools Used
- Python
- SQLite
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## Steps Performed
1. Created SQLite database and tables
2. Inserted transaction and fraud data
3. Loaded SQL data into Python
4. Performed data preprocessing
5. Trained a machine learning model
6. Visualized fraud patterns using graphs

## Machine Learning Model
- Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier
- Target Variable: Fraud (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

## Results
The model successfully identifies fraud patterns based on transaction amount, city, and payment method.

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Run all cells from top to bottom
